<h1>The Pencil Code Team</h1>

<p>The Pencil Code Foundation is devoted to advancing computer
science education by making programming as simple and as
powerful as using a pencil.

<p>Our project grew out of an open-source hobby and
a collaboration between Googler David Bau, his son Anthony, and
a group of friends.

<p>Before <a href="//pencilcode.net">pencilcode.net</a>,
we had created a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020210113129/http://notesbydave.com/htmlpad/script.htm">series of</a>
<a href="http://dabbler.org/home/00-about/00-README.html">online</a>
<a href="http://js.dabbler.org/">programming tools</a> which we
used to teach Javascript at a variety of urban and suburban
classrooms.

<p>Each time we taught, we learned what was hard, we
watched where the tool got in the way, and we built a better
tool the next time.
Pencil Code is the 5th iteration.

<p>When the latest tool emphasizing CoffeeScript
was picked up by David's brother's school
for use in many of their classrooms, David realized it filled
a need.  (David's brother Kevin teaches math at Beaver Country Day,
home of the <a href=
"http://bcdschool.org/tag/coded-curriculum/">coded curriculum</a>.)


<p>The latest addition
(<a href="https://github.com/droplet-editor/droplet"
>Droplet, the dual-mode block and text editor</a>)
was created by Anthony Bau.  It was inspired by
Hal Abelson's observation that perceived
differences between blocks and text were a
significant problem, a gap that Droplet now
bridges beautifully.

<h2>Who We Are</h2>

<p>Pencil Code is the work of many of
devoted students, teachers, open-source
contributors, and volunteers.  We welcome
your participation too: here is
our <a href="http://dev.pencilcode.net/"
>contributor's portal</a>.

<p>David Bau is a part-time programmer at Google who is
beginning work on a late-career PhD at MIT.
At Google, David helped create
Google Talk (now called Hangouts) and
algorithms for Google Search and Google Image Search.
Prior to his ten years at Google, David built
Internet Explorer and .NET platform tools at
Microsoft and open-source Java enterprise tools
at Crossgain and BEA Systems.  He is a volunteer
teacher with Citizen Schools, and he is
coauthor of a textbook on numerical linear algebra.
Google uses Pencil Code in its computer science
outreach programs, and it generously supports
David's open-source contributions.

<p>Anthony Bau is a high school student at
Phillips Exeter Academy and president of the
Exeter Computing Club. He runs HackExeter,
a precollege hackathon, and he teaches a
Junior Computing Club for middle schoolers.
Prior to Exeter, Anthony was a member of the
Lincoln Gear Ticks, national winners at the
2011 First Lego League robotics championship.
Anthony learned to program using Scratch, Python,
and Javascript, and he created Droplet based
on those experiences. Code.org uses Droplet
in its CSP curriculum tool, and it supports
Anthony through an internship for his
open-source contributions to Droplet.

<p>Xinan Liu, a student at National University
of Singapore, contributed the icon-based
directory UI, screen shots of student projects,
and the browserify-based Pencil Code build.

<p>Saksham Aggarwal, a student at IIIT
Hyderabad, contributed the HTML block mode
editor and several core improvements to Droplet.

<p>Jeremy Ruten, a student in Saskatoon Canada,
is developing pencil-tracer, a code transpiler
that traces execution flow and variable state
in CoffeeScript and JavaScript.

<p>Amanda Boss, an intern at Google and student
at Harvard, is developing a timeline interface
that will allow students to rewind their programs.

<p>Cali Stenson, an intern at Google and student
at Wellesley, is building a UI for visualizing
execution traces and changes to variable state.

<p>Chris Pirich, an engineer at Code.org, modified
Droplet to work well when embedded in the code.org tutorial environment.

<p>Brent Van Minnen, an engineer at Code.org,
contributed the ability to drag palette
blocks in text mode in Droplet.

<p>Sydney Pickens, a Google technical program
manager, curated the block palette, and ran a research
study testing efficacy of Pencil Code in classrooms.

<p>Matthew Dawson, a teacher and product manager
for Google, created and tested lessons as part
of a pilot class and research study for Pencil Code.

<p>David Weintrop, a PhD student at Northwestern,
is doing educational research on the transition
between blocks and text, using his own
customized version of Pencil Code.

<p>Cindy Yang and Ji-Sun Ham, students at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education,
created a curriculum, videos, and Pencil Cards
used in Citizen School classrooms.

<p>Caroline Meeks, a charter school teacher at
Prospect Hill Academy, is a strategic advisor
for Pencil Code, the tool in her classroom
and helping to map the CS ed tech space.

<p>Jeremiah Blanchard, a PhD student at
University of Florida and program director
at Full Sail University, is developing a
python mode for use in his classrooms.

<p>Siddhartha Sahai, a student at BITS Pilani,
is developing a promise-based await extension to
Iced CoffeeScript.

<p>Yana Malysheva, a Google engineer, is mentoring
students and also developing the promise-based
await extensions.

<p>Bob Cassels, a Google engineer, is contributing
a Scheme-inspired arbitrary-precision arithmetic
mode for Pencil Code and CoffeeScript.

<p>Anand Ramakrishna, a Microsoft engineer, wrote
the node.js backend that serves and stores
Pencil Code programs.

<p>Joe Beda, who is ex-Google and ex-Microsoft,
contributed the production setup that runs
Pencil Code on Google Comptue Engine.

<p>Amy Briggs, a CS professor at Middlebury,
and teaching assistant Tom Dobrow,
Tom Dobrow designed and taught a college CS course
for nonmajors using Pencil Code.

<p>Pavel Simakov, a Google engineer, contributed the
capabiliity to embed and integrate Pencil Code
as a widget into other tutorial websites.

<p>Googlers D Feher, David Saff, and Alison Cichowlas,
contributed the Pencil Code Gym tutorial website.

<p>Rachel Nicoll, a project manager at the MassTLC
Education Foundation, organized and created activities
for our first Hour of Code activity in 2014.

<p>Alexander Wei, a Phillips Exeter student,
contributed the capability to use tranparent images
as nonrectangular sprites.

<p>Kim Arcand, a NASA astronomer, and Gus Muench,
an AAS astronmer, contributed the Hour of Code
activity that lets students program with authentic multiwavelength astronomical image data.

<p>Joshua Greene, Jennifer Hardy,
Clayton Weston, Kelly Powers, Elaine Griggs, Kevin Bau,
Rob MacDonald, Whitney McKnight, David Case,
and Karene Hines are teachers
who brought Pencil Code into their classrooms
and contributed particularly valuable guidance,
experience, and lesson ideas.

<p>Ramakrushna Arugollu, Latisha Silvera,
Kevin Egan, Joy Basu (all at John Hancock),
Ethan Apter, Eric Steinlauf, Nikhil Thorat,
Emily Bernier, David Miller, Norris Boyd,
James Synge, Jun Lee, Greg Dennis, and Thomas
Colthurst (at Google), taught Citizen Schools and
Girls Who Code classes using our tools, and
helped develop valuable improvements.

<p>Special thanks to Google managers Maggie Johnson,
Steve Vinter, Marika Marchegger, Jamie Sue Goodman, and
Chris Stevenson, who have all supported David in his
quest to contribute to computer science education, and
to Code.org managers Hadi Partovi and Sarah Filman,
who have supported Anthony in his pioneering
work on Droplet.  Thanks to Google Summer of Code
for financial support for the open-source contributions
of three summer students.

<p>Pencil Code is an open-source project that builds on
CoffeeScript, a langage created by Jeremy Ashkenas and
Max Krohn, and on many other open source libraries.
Pencil Code is only possible because
of the inventiveness and generosity of the vibrant
Javascript open source community.  The libraries
that we incorporate under open licenses are listed
<a href="http://pencilcode.net/license.html">here</a>.
